Differences between GUI (graphical user interfaces) and CLI (command-line interface.) 
CLI is based on issuing commands
GUI is involves visual elements- (windows, buttons, etc.)
Both types have pros and cons but their creative purpose remains the same.
Pro/s of CLI: it consumes less memory, has higher precision and is faster than GUI. Con/s- its more difficult to use.
Pro/s of GUI: easy to use, appearences can be modified, can show more than just text(images&videos.) Con/s- is slower than CLI and takes more memory.
